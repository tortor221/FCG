                               <p>An analysis of the software development industry shows that demand for highly specialized solutions remains high but competition in the field is even higher. In order to grow, Carrollton Group may need to pivot its existing strategy and possibly even add a few more services to its portfolio in order to differentiate itself. As consumer demands for tailored solutions collide with increasing commoditization of software programming, Carrollton's software development BU must clearly outline its core strengths and focus on developing those in order to prosper.</p>

With projected operating revenues in excess of $1mm for FY2014 and a malleable proprietary technology platform the company is poised for rapid growth or acquisition. The ChapterSpot database management and web applet tools, while originally designed as a tool for college Greek-life organizations, is an adaptable tool that provides dynamic membership management system. The essential design of the website and DB system has always been to seamlessly connect the membership of an organization in today's increasingly connected and diverse digital landscape. As Finke and McMenemon work to continually improve the client base, there now exists a need to determine the best steps forward for this expanding company.</p>

                               <p>For twenty-five years, Christ Episcopal School has sought to live out its mission with a humble earnestness of purpose. Throughout that time our campus has continued to develop into an environment where each person's uniqueness is intrinsically valued. We seek to remember and act upon the definitive belief that each child manifests God's creative love passing through the prism of the parents, and refracts a new manifestation of "God in the World." Therefore each student is a wonder; "called by name." God called each of our children by name before we knew they were ours. So, we seek not to manage but guide them through wisdom, opportunity, encouragement and, yes, mandates to progress through recognized developmental goals on the intellectual, spiritual, moral, social, and physical planes.</p>

                               <p>Grove Transit was founded in 2010 to meet the growing need for non-emergency medical transportation. The company is based out of Hattiesburg, MI, where the rapidly growing senior citizen population and the presence of world-class medical facilities presented a unique opportunity to provide transportation services.</p>

From chic restaurants to retail establishments and cozy music clubs, the one block long pedestrian-only Fulton Street Mall offers visitors an exciting night out on the town.</p>

                               <p>Fulton Street has a number of options for diners. Grab a freshly-brewed beer with Ahi tuna or barbecued salmon at Gordon Biersch. Sample some Oyster Rockerfeller and enjoy crab claws or barbecue quail at Grand Isle where the seafood comes right to the table from the waters of the Gulf of Mexico without touching the freezer. Or, savor a succulent steak seared to perfection at 1800 degrees at Ruth's Chris Steak House.</p>

                               <p>Fulton Street is home to the 25,000-square-foot Fulton Square, an outdoor event space that plays host to block parties, concerts and special events. In December, Fulton Street dresses in its finest holiday décor with Christmas trees, lights, mistletoes and fleur de lis ornaments for the annual "Miracle on Fulton Street."</p>

                               <p>There is artificial snow, strolling costumed characters, local musical acts and holiday-themed dining. The New Orleans Seafood Festival brings live music, fried seafood and family fun to Fulton Square in October.</p>

                               <p>The Tulane National Primate Research Center (TNPRC) is one of the largest of eight National Primate Research Centers in the country, housing about 5,000 primates on a 500-acre campus on the Northshore. The Center has more than 300 employees, including 35 doctoral level scientists and clinical veterinarians, and about 200,000sf of research space. As part of the National Primate Research Center Program, TNPRC is largely supported by federal grants through the National Institutes of Health (NIH). We are interested in exploring new business development strategies and expanding our current business model to bring in additional funding from the private sector.</p>

                               <p>The research program at the TNPRC has focused heavily on infectious disease research for more than three decades. The major areas of funding in this program are currently AIDS, Lyme disease, tuberculosis and vaccines and mechanisms to protect against bioterrorism. These are multidisciplinary studies involving investigators in several Divisions at the TNPRC and collaborators outside the Center. Common to these studies is a focus on disease origination and progression and on using such research findings to develop vaccines, diagnostics and therapeutics to treat these diseases. Discoveries utilizing the in-house research expertise at the TNPRC have led to diagnostics tests approved by USDA and the FDA for commercial sale, as well as numerous human clinical trials of vaccines and therapeutics. Although the majority of the Center’s research efforts are devoted to infectious disease, a significant program in regenerative medicine has also developed which is closely linked to the Center for Stem Cell Research and Regenerative Medicine at Tulane. This research is focused on developing new therapies for diseases including osteoporosis, Parkinson's disease, spinal injuries, diabetes and Alzheimer's.</p>
                               
                               <p>To date, federal grant funding has made up more than 90% of the Center's $30M annual budget.  We now wish to expand our business model beyond this grant support by developing public private partnerships and business relationships to utilize our expertise and experiences in pre- clinical research to further our mission to improve human and animal health. In the process, we hope to make a greater contribution to the development of products that treat disease as well as to further economic development in the region. The proposed project would be a strategic analysis of opportunities to expand the Center's current business model with services the private sector would consider funding.</p>
